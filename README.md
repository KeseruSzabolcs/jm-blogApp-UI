# UI of a Blog post project

This is the UI, of a single page blog post project. For a simple user we have login, posts, comments, search, view profile options. For admin, we have also included users list. The UI is created using React and react-bootstrap, in the central store we are using redux toolkit, for the API requests we are using axios.

### Getting started

- Download the project
- open a terminal in the root of the project
- check if you have node.js installed by running "node -v" in the terminal, if you don't have it installed, [you can install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- check if you have npm installed by running "npm -v" in the terminal, if you don't have it installed, run "npm install -g npm"
- run "npm i" in the terminal
- after the packages are installed, run "npm start"
- if "Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported" error occurred, stop the process with "ctrl + c" and run "npm run start2"
- if everything went well, we should see a new tab opening in our browser, when the process is finished"
